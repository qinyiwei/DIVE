{"level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "Chandra has four bowls.  Each one is a different color (red, blue, yellow, green).  She also has exactly one glass the same color as each bowl.  If she chooses a bowl and a glass from the cupboard, how many pairings are possible?  One such pairing is a blue bowl and a yellow glass.", "answer": "There are four different bowls and four different glasses that Chandra can pick. Since her choices are mutually exclusive, there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ possible pairings."}
{"level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "The distance between two cities on a map is 15 inches. If the scale is 0.25 inches = 3 miles, how many miles apart are the actual cities?", "answer": "If 0.25 inches represents 3 miles, we have that 1 inch represents 12 miles. Therefore, 15 inches represents $\\boxed{180\\text{ miles}}$."}
{"level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "How many prime numbers are between 20 and 30?", "answer": "Checking the primes 2, 3, and 5 as potential divisors, we see that there are $\\boxed{2}$ prime numbers between 20 and 30: 23 and 29."}
{"level": "Level 5", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "How many positive integers less than $101$ are multiples of either $5$ or $7$, but not both at once?", "answer": "There are $20$ positive multiples of $5$ less than $101$.  There are $14$ positive multiples of $7$ less than $101$.  However, the least common multiple of $5$ and $7$ is $35$, and there are $2$ positive multiples of $35$ less than $101$.  This means there are $20 - 2 = 18$ multiples of $5$ that aren't multiples of $7$, and $14 - 2 = 12$ multiples of 7 that aren't multiples of $5$, for a total of $18 + 12 = \\boxed{30}$."}
{"level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "What is $\\frac{2^2 \\cdot 2^{-3}}{2^3 \\cdot 2^{-2}}$?", "answer": "We compute that \\[\\frac{2^2 \\cdot 2^{-3}}{2^3 \\cdot 2^{-2}} = \\frac{2^{2 - 3}}{2^{3 - 2}} = \\frac{2^{-1}}{2^1} = 2^{-1 - 1} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.\\]"}
{"level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "What is the value of $\\dfrac{3 \\times 4}{6}?$", "answer": "Calculating the numerator first, $\\dfrac{3 \\times 4}{6} = \\dfrac{12}{6} = \\boxed{2}$."}
{"level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "A gift shop offers free gift wrapping. They have eight varieties of wrapping paper, three colors of ribbon, and four types of gift cards. Using one variety of wrapping paper, one color of ribbon and one type of gift card, how many combinations are possible?", "answer": "There are $8\\times 3\\times 4=\\boxed{96}$ ways to make three decisions if there are 8, 3, and 4 options available for the decisions."}
{"level": "Level 5", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "In the diagram below, $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$ and $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$.

Letting $x = \\angle AXE$, we have $x = 3x - 108^\\circ$.  Solving this equation gives $x = 54^\\circ$.  We therefore have $\\angle BXY = \\angle AXE = \\boxed{54^\\circ}$."}
{"level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "Simplify $1-(1+(1-(1+(1-x))))$.", "answer": "Starting from the furthest inside the parentheses and working outwards, we get $1-(1+(1-(1+(1-x))))=1-(1+(1-(2-x)))$. $1-(1+(1-(2-x)))=(1-(1+(x-1))$. $(1-(1+(x-1))=\\boxed{1-x}$."}
{"level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "question": "Set $B = \\{55, 57, 58, 59, 61\\}.$  Which number in set B has the smallest prime factor?", "answer": "The smallest prime is 2, which is a factor of every even number.  Because $\\boxed{58}$ is the only even number, it has the smallest prime factor."}
