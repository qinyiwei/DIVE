numglue_examples='''Question: 
A football team practices for 6 hours daily. This week they could not practice due to rain on 1 days. Find the total number of hours they practiced this week.
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
1. **Practice hours per day**: The football team practices for 6 hours daily.
2. **Number of practice days in a week**: There are typically 7 days in a week.
3. **Rainy days**: The team could not practice due to rain on 1 day.
Now, let's calculate the total number of practice hours for the week:
\[ \text{Total practice hours} = (\text{Practice hours per day}) \times (\text{Number of practice days in a week} - \text{Rainy days}) \]
Substitute the given values:
\[ \text{Total practice hours} = (6 \, \text{hours/day}) \times (7 \, \text{days/week} - 1 \, \text{rainy day}) \]
\[ \text{Total practice hours} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days} \]
\[ \text{Total practice hours} = 36 \, \text{hours} \]
Therefore, the football team practiced for a total of 36 hours this week.

Question: 
Shirley sold 20 boxes of Do-Si-Dos. Shirley needs to deliver _____ cases of 4 boxes, plus extra boxes .
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
To determine how many cases of 4 boxes Shirley needs to deliver and the number of extra boxes, we can use division and remainder.
Shirley sold 20 boxes of Do-Si-Dos. To find out how many cases of 4 boxes that corresponds to, you can divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per case:
\[ \text{Number of cases} = \frac{\text{Total number of boxes}}{\text{Boxes per case}} \]
In this case:
\[ \text{Number of cases} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]
So, Shirley needs to deliver 5 cases of 4 boxes each. 
Now, to find the number of extra boxes, you can find the remainder of the division:
\[ \text{Number of extra boxes} = \text{Total number of boxes} \mod \text{Boxes per case} \]
In this case:
\[ \text{Number of extra boxes} = 20 \mod 4 = 0 \]
Since the remainder is 0, there are no extra boxes beyond the complete cases. Therefore, Shirley needs to deliver 5 cases of 4 boxes each.

Question: 
Mary has 9.0 yellow marbles. She gave Joan 3.0 yellow marbles. How many yellow marbles will Mary have left.
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
To find out how many yellow marbles Mary will have left after giving Joan 3.0 yellow marbles, you need to subtract the number of marbles given from the total number of marbles Mary initially had.
Initial number of yellow marbles Mary had = 9.0
Number of yellow marbles given to Joan = 3.0
\[ \text{Yellow marbles left} = \text{Initial number} - \text{Number given} \]
\[ \text{Yellow marbles left} = 9.0 - 3.0 = 6.0 \]
So, Mary will have 6.0 yellow marbles left after giving Joan 3.0 yellow marbles.
