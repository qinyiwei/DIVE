In the BIG N, a middle school football conference, each team plays every other team exactly once. If a total of 21 conference games were played during the 2012 season, how many teams were members of the BIG N conference?\nYou are provided with the following options for your answer:\nA : 6  \nB : 7 \nC : 8 \nD : 9 \nE : 10
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
1. The problem states that in the BIG N conference, each team plays every other team exactly once. We need to find out how many teams were members of the BIG N conference.\n2. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of consecutive numbers, 1 to x, that can fit into 21.\n3. By observation, we can see that 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21.\n4. However, this count does not include the 7th team that shook hands with the other 6 teams.\n5. Therefore, there are 7 teams in the BIG N conference.\n6. [Final solution] Therefore, the final result is 7.\nBy problem, the option corresponding to 7 is B.\nSo our selection is option B. [ANSWERKEY] B

Question: 
What is the value of \\[(\\log 5)^{3}+(\\log 20)^{3}+(\\log 8)(\\log 0.25)\\] where $\\log$ denotes the base-ten logarithm?\nYou are provided with the following options for your answer:\nA : $\\frac{3}{2}$  \nB : $\\frac{7}{4}$ \nC : $2$ \nD : $\\frac{9}{4}$ \nE : $3$.
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
1. The problem asks us to find the value of \\[(\\log 5)^{3}+(\\log 20)^{3}+(\\log 8)(\\log 0.25)\\] where \\(\\log\\) denotes the base-ten logarithm.\n2. We can use the sum of cubes formula to simplify the expression \\((\\log 5)^{3}+(\\log 20)^{3}\\).\n3. According to the sum of cubes formula, \\(a^{3}+b^{3}=(a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2})\\).\n4. Applying the sum of cubes formula to \\((\\log 5)^{3}+(\\log 20)^{3}\\), we get \\((\\log 5 + \\log 20)((\\log 5)^{2}-(\\log 5)(\\log 20) + (\\log 20)^{2})\\).\n5. Simplifying further, we have \\(2((\\log 5)^{2}-(\\log 5)(2\\log 2 + \\log 5) + (2\\log 2 + \\log 5)^{2})\\).\n6. Let \\(x = \\log 5\\) and \\(y = \\log 2\\), so \\(x+y=1\\).\n7. Substituting \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into the expression, we get \\(2(x^2-x(2y+x)+(2y+x)^2)-6y^2\\).\n8. Simplifying the expression, we have \\(2(x^2+2xy+4y^2-3y^2)\\).\n9. Further simplifying, we get \\(2(x+y)^2 = 2\\).\n10. Therefore, the final result is \\(\\boxed{(C) 2}\\).\n11. By problem, the option corresponding to 2 is C.\n12. So our selection is option C.

Question: 
There is a unique positive integer $n$ such that $\\log_2{(\\log_{16}{n})} = \\log_4{(\\log_4{n})}$. What is the sum of the digits of $n$?\nYou are provided with the following options for your answer:\nA : $4$  \nB : $7$ \nC : $8$ \nD : $11$ \nE : $13$ 
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
1. The problem states that there is a unique positive integer n such that log base 2 of log base 16 of n is equal to log base 4 of log base 4 of n. We need to find the sum of the digits of n.\n2. We will apply the logarithmic identity log base p of q raised to the power of k is equal to log base p of q, which can be proven by the Change of Base Formula. This identity states that log base p of q raised to the power of k is equal to log base p of q. \n3. Note that log base 16 of n is not equal to 0, so we can rewrite the original equation as follows: log base 4 of log base 16 of n squared is equal to log base 4 of log base 4 of n.\n4. This can be further simplified to (log base 16 of n) squared is equal to log base 16 of n squared. \n5. Simplifying further, we get (log base 16 of n) squared is equal to 2 times log base 16 of n.\n6. From this equation, we can deduce that log base 16 of n is equal to 2. \n7. Solving for n, we find that n is equal to 16 squared, which is 256.\n8. The sum of the digits of 256 is 2 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n9. [Final solution] Therefore, the final result is 13.\n10. By problem, the option corresponding to 13 is E.\n11. So our selection is option E. [ANSWERKEY] E

Question: A customer who intends to purchase an appliance has three coupons, only one of which may be used. For which of the following listed prices will coupon 1 offer a greater price reduction than either coupon 2 or coupon 3?\nYou are provided with the following options for your answer:\nA : $\\textdollar179.95$  \nB : $\\textdollar199.95$ \nC : $\\textdollar219.95$ \nD : $\\textdollar239.95$ \nE : $\\textdollar259.95$
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
1. The problem states that a customer has three coupons, but only one can be used. We need to determine which listed price will result in coupon 1 offering a greater price reduction than either coupon 2 or coupon 3.\n2. To determine if coupon 1 is the most effective, we want the price reduction to be greater than 20% of the price. This occurs if the value is over 200.\n3. To determine if coupon 1 is more effective than coupon 3, we want to minimize the value over 200. Therefore, the smallest number over 200 is $219.95.\n4. [Final solution] Therefore, the final result is $219.95.\nBy problem, the option corresponding to $219.95 is C.\nSo our selection is option C. [ANSWERKEY] C
