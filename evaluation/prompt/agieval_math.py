If $\\frac{x-1}{3}=k$ and $k=3$, what is the value of $x ?$ Answer Choices: (A)2 (B)4 (C)9 (D)10\nA: Among A through D, the answer is?
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
The given equation is: \(\frac{x-1}{3} = k\)
And it is given that \(k = 3\).
Substitute \(k\) with \(3\) in the equation:
\(\frac{x-1}{3} = 3\)
Now, to solve for \(x\), you can multiply both sides of the equation by \(3\) to get rid of the denominator:
\(x - 1 = 3 \times 3\)
\(x - 1 = 9\)
Now, add 1 to both sides to isolate \(x\):
\(x = 9 + 1\)
\(x = 10\)
So, the value of \(x\) is \(10\).
Now, among the answer choices (A) through (D), the correct answer is (D)10.
[ANSWERKEY] D

Question: 
For $i=\\sqrt{-1}$, what is the sum $(7+3 i)+(-8+9 i) ?$ Answer Choices: (A)$-1+12 i$ (B)$-1-6 i$ (C)$15+12 i$ (D)$15-6 i$ 3\nA: Among A through D, the answer is?
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
The given sum is \((7+3i) + (-8+9i)\).
Combine the real parts (the parts without \(i\)) separately and the imaginary parts (the parts with \(i\)) separately:
Real part: \(7 - 8 = -1\)
Imaginary part: \(3i + 9i = 12i\)
So, the sum is \(-1 + 12i\).
Among the answer choices (A) through (D), the correct answer is (A) \(-1 + 12i\).
[ANSWERKEY] A

Question: 
On Saturday afternoon, Armand sent $m$ text messages each hour for 5 hours, and Tyrone sent $p$ text messages each hour for 4 hours. Which of the following represents the total number of messages sent by Armand and Tyrone on Saturday afternoon? Answer Choices: (A)$9 m p$ (B)$20 m p$ (C)$5 m+4 p$ (D)$4 m+5 p$\nA: Among A through D, the answer is?
Let's think step by step.
Answer: 
Armand sent $m$ text messages each hour for 5 hours, so the total number of messages sent by Armand is $5m$.
Tyrone sent $p$ text messages each hour for 4 hours, so the total number of messages sent by Tyrone is $4p$.
The total number of messages sent by Armand and Tyrone together is the sum of the messages they individually sent:
Total = Armand's messages + Tyrone's messages
      = $5m + 4p$
Now let's compare this expression with the answer choices:
(A) $9mp$
(B) $20mp$
(C) $5m + 4p$
(D) $4m + 5p$
Comparing the expression $5m + 4p$ with the answer choices, we can see that the correct choice is (C) $5m + 4p$.
